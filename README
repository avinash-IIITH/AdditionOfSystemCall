Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.




The linux kernel code has been modified to add new System call.

Project Goal
============
Add a new system call in linux which will print the number of times each of these four
(fork/vfork/execve/clone system calls) system calls has been invoked since OS boot up.

Major Objectives of the Project
===============================
1-> Instrument the kernel to provide the Number of times fork/vfork/execve/clone system 
    calls have been invoked (since the OS booted).This count could be reset by the user
	anytime.
2-> Make Systems Call/s to add the above stated functionality/ies to the kernel.
3-> Once the functionalities have been added, the compilation of the kernel takes place.
4-> Once the kernel has been compiled, a boot image has to be created using the kernel which
	has to be loaded into the GRUB loader so that it becomes available to us while loading of the
	kernel during system up.
5-> Put the request to these system call/s in a function inside the user level program. It
	will retrieve these statistics from the kernal space and provide them to the user according to
	requirements.
6-> Including a header file which contains a call to our user level program, so that users
	can just include the header and make a function call to get the desired counts.
